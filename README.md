## Project Background
The exercise routine generator is a personal project I created to generate core routines. 
The program chooses exercises from the exercise bank file, which lists exercises in multiple difficulties. 
The program will sequentially pick an exercise from each difficulty until the number of desired exercises is reached. 
The newRoutine file stores your last generated routine, and past routines are stored in the pastRoutines file.  

## How to Use the Project
Press the green code button, download the ZIP, and extract the folder. 
Open ExerciseRoutineGenerator.sln, then open RoutineGenerator.cpp in source files.
Then run the program.
The generated routine will be in newRoutine.txt
